This is my personal website. It's built with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/), hosted on
[NearlyFreeSpeech.NET](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/), using the
[Read the Docs Theme](https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme) theme.

I use [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Robpol86/robpol86.com) to automatically build and push HTML files to NFSN
(using [SCVersioning](https://robpol86.github.io/sphinxcontrib-versioning/)) every time I push them to this GitHub repo.
