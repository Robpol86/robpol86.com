# Golf Alltrack SE

This page is a log book of all the modifications I've done to my 2019 Alltrack.

## 21-08 Photo

Taken off of Shoreline Hwy in Stinson Beach CA.

## 21-08 P3 Vent Gauge

Installed this to have a boost gauge in my air vent:
[P3 V3 OBD2 - VW Mk7 / Mk7.5 Gauge (2014-2020)](https://www.p3cars.com/volkswagen/p3-v3-obd2-vw-mk7-mk7-5-gauge-2014-2019/)

I didn't bother hooking up the dimmer wire since you can dim it manually by holding the right button. I mounted the
controller box using zip ties (it's on tight and doesn't move at all) and I heatshrinked the unused wires to avoid any
potential shorts.

## 21-06 Fire Extinguisher

Bought a rechargeable 2.5 lb fire extinguisher from Amazon:
[Amerex Dry Chemical Fire Extinguisher B417T](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VXRYCM)

I then zip tied it to my car placing some velcro around the fire extinguisher, so it's easy to pull out during an emergency.
It stays put after driving for weeks and doesn't get in the way of lifting the cover to access my spare tire.

## 21-05 AirTag

I found that the best place to put an AirTag on my car is behind the front VW emblem out of the way of the radar sensor. The
cover is plastic, so it doesn't hurt bluetooth range that much. I can also hear the AirTag play its sound from a decent
distance in a parking lot.

## 20-02 Dashcam

I installed a BlackVue dashcam along with three batteries to get about 2 days of recoding time while my vehicle is parked. I
live in San Francisco and while my car is parked overnight in a garage, I occasionally park my car in the street and after a
year nobody has broken in to steal the camera.

As a precaution I bought the tamper-proof case so a thief can't just pull out the wires and take the camera. Additionally I
zip-tied the wires tightly to the internal metal part of my rearview mirror (and threaded it through a narrow hole for more
strength). Hopefully this means anyone that wants to steal the camera will need to bring a knife or scissors along, and I'm
hoping those are the minority of opportunistic thieves in the city.

```{note}
I suggest covering up unused ports on the BlackVue battery with electrical tape. When I was unplugging and plugging in wires
I accidentally plugged the input power cable in the expansion port of the main battery, sending 12v from the battery back to
my car. Luckily nothing broke but I kept getting ABS errors until I figured out my mistake.
```

### Items Purchased

In the photos below you'll see two pairs of wires from my fusebox and four batteries. I ran a second wire from a second
tapped fuse since I may add a second pair of cameras in the future. You'll only need to run one pair of wires. Use **15 amp**
fuses if you're going with the batteries, you can tap either
[fuse 48 or 36](https://fuse-box.info/volkswagen/volkswagen-golf-vii-mk7-2013-2020-fuses).

## 20-02 Under-Seat Drawer

Just like my old TDI I wanted the OEM drawer under the driver seat to store things. Unlike my old TDI there is no passenger
seat drawer available for the Alltrack. While installing, I also lined the drawer and the dash cubby that came with the car\
with felt so things wouldn't rattle.

I bought the drawer for $156 on ECS Tuning:
[Driver's Seat Tray Kit Titanium Black 5GM 882 599 KT](https://www.ecstuning.com/b-genuine-volkswagen-audi-parts/drivers-seat-tray-kit-titanium-black/5gm882599kt/)

Sadly it's no longer available.
