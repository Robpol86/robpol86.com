# Desk Photos 2017

## January

I've decided to get rid of my rack cabinet in my living room, so I started by moving my Mac Pro onto my desk and running ethernet cables through the wall. Also with my larger IKEA bed I had to rotate my desk 90 degrees to make everything fit.

## December: Work @ Apple

Forgive me for having a tech-hipster breakfast. Misusing reams of paper at the office will never go out of style though.
