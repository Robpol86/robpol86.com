# Desk Photos 2013

## July: Work @ Symantec

I took this picture shortly before leaving Symantec. The office kept shrinking, people leaving but nobody being hired. I managed to get a nice window cubicle for a few months in the end.

## October

My server rack with my computer in it is on the other side of the wall to keep my room cool in the evening. I had to cut a hole in the separating wall through sheetrock, plywood, and asbestos.

## November: Work @ Twitter

San Francisco start ups don't believe in cubicles. Open floor plans aren't that bad I suppose. I took this during Hack Week early in the morning. I was excited to work on my project.
