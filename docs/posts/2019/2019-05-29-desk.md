```

## June

New apartment again. Got my Sonic symmetrical gigabit internet back. Also got a whiteboard for home since I liked having one at work.

## October: Work @ Apple

Moved buildings in the South Bay. This one has offices instead of cubicles. Sharing this with one other person. This was my last desk at Apple.
