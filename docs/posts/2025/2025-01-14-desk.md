# Desk Photos 2025

## January: Mexico City

I came across the [OWC Thunderbolt Go Dock](https://www.owc.com/solutions/thunderbolt-go-dock) whilst staying in Japan. It
replaced my USB-C power adapters and the StarTech USB-C hub. It also has a built-in power supply so no power brick. I use it
to charge my MacBook and power my external monitor and even charge my USB-C thoothbrush/shaver/powerbank/phone/watch charger.

I also bought the [Aiffro K100](https://www.aiffro.com/products/all-ssd-nas-k100) to replace my
[DIY NAS](../2024/2024-05-04-nas.md). It's great that it's USB-PD, too bad the Go Dock's USB-C peripheral ports only output
15 watts, so I still need a separate power brick for it. Luckily the
[Anker 543 Charger](https://www.anker.com/products/a2046) has the same C7 style power cable so I bought a
[splitter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QGZKQRX). Some hotels only give you one power outlet near the desk! My hotel in
Mexico City only has two power outlets in the entire room (plus one in the bathroom) and one is taken up by the TV lol.

That circuit board sticking out of the Aiffro is my boot drive for TrueNAS Scale
([USB-C to NVMe M.2](https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Enclosure-10Gbps-Adapter-Supports/dp/B0CQ4NXK7Q) adapter).

## February: El Calafate

My journey took me to El Calafate in southern Argentina, and this is the desk they gave me! No available power outlets on
this wall either! Luckily the TV above the "desk" uses an unpolarized C7 power cable so I'm borrowing it during my stay.

## July: Sydney

Ditched the Aiffro for the more reliable Beelink ME Mini. I also started using a GL.iNet Slate 7 travel router. Everything is
2.5 GbE, and I get better throughput to hotel WiFi now. Sometimes going from 5 Mbps on my MacBook to 75 on the GL.iNet even
when they're right next to each other!
