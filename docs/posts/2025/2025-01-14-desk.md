# Desk Photo 2025

I came across the [OWC Thunderbolt Go Dock](https://www.owc.com/solutions/thunderbolt-go-dock) whilst staying in Japan. It
replaced my USB-C power adapters and the StarTech USB-C hub. It also has a built-in power supply so no power brick. I use it
to charge my MacBook and power my external monitor and even charge my USB-C thoothbrush/shaver/powerbank/phone/watch charger.

I also bought the [Aiffro K100](https://www.aiffro.com/products/all-ssd-nas-k100) to replace my DIY NAS. It's great that it's
USB-PD, too bad the Go Dock's USB-C peripheral ports only output 15 watts, so I still need a separate power brick for it.
Luckily the [Anker 543 Charger](https://www.anker.com/products/a2046) has the same C7 style power cable so I bought a
[splitter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QGZKQRX). Some hotels only give you one power outlet near the desk! My hotel in
Mexico City only has two power outlets in the entire room (plus one in the bathroom) and one is taken up by the TV lol.
