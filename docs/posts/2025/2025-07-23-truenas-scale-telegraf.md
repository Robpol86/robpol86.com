This guide will explain how to run [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/),
[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/), and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) on
[TrueNAS SCALE](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/). This is how I run all three apps on
my [Beelink ME Mini](https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-me-mini-n150) NAS. As of this writing I'm running TrueNAS
SCALE 25.04.1 (Fangtooth). The scope of this guide is to implement homelab-tier monitoring on a single node.

Ever since I saw [MRTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_Router_Traffic_Grapher) graphs at my first job at an ISP in 2003,
I've always wanted to collect metrics and visualize them in graphs. Things like free disk space or CPU temperatures. I ran
MRTG on my homelab file server for a few years, then tried [RRDtool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRDtool) for a bit. It was
in 2015 at Uber where I learned about Grafana and fell in love with it. Not so much the Graphite backend they were using at
the time. I first started running my own Grafana at home in 2017 with InfluxDB and Telegraf.

```{seealso}
This guide is written for InfluxDB v2, which is the version used by the latest TrueNAS app at this time. An earlier version
of this guide was written for InfluxDB v1. You can access it here:
https://github.com/Robpol86/robpol86.com/blob/4c9c31827b3fae5e85d1aa9543649868f33b9652/docs/posts/2025/2025-07-23-truenas-scale-telegraf.md
```

## Prerequisites

Before starting there are a few things we need to setup:

1. Choose a pool for apps if you haven't used apps in TrueNAS before
1. Create datasets for each application

### Choose a Pool

The first step for enabling apps on TrueNAS is to select a pool. In a typical home NAS you'll probably only have one pool
where you store all of your files; go ahead and select that pool. On my NAS I've named my pool **Vault**. Substitute that
with your pool's name.

1. In the TrueNAS UI go to ➡️ Apps
1. Click on **Configuration** and then **Choose Pool**
1. Select a pool (e.g. Vault)

### Create Datasets

Next we'll be creating a few datasets. We'll create a dataset named **Apps** just for organization, and within it we'll
create datasets for each individual app. This is the structure we'll be using:

```
Vault (pool)
└── Apps
    ├── InfluxDB
    ├── Grafana
    └── Telegraf
```

1. In the TrueNAS UI go to ➡️ Datasets
1. Click on **Vault** then **Add Dataset**
    1. **Name**: Apps
    1. **Dataset Preset**: Apps
    1. Save
1. Click on the new **Apps** dataset then **Add Dataset** again
    1. **Name**: InfluxDB
    1. **Dataset Preset**: Apps
    1. Save
    1. Return to Pool List
    1. *Repeat for Grafana and Telegraf*

```{imgur-figure} sZ4tExJ
You should now see something like this.
```

### Create Subdirectories

Grafana and InfluxDB both require seperate directories for their configurations and data. You can create them by going to the
TrueNAS shell under ➡️ System > Shell. Then run these commands:

```bash
mkdir /mnt/Vault/Apps/InfluxDB/config
mkdir /mnt/Vault/Apps/InfluxDB/data
mkdir /mnt/Vault/Apps/Grafana/plugins
mkdir /mnt/Vault/Apps/Grafana/data
```

## InfluxDB

We'll be using the official InfluxDB TrueNAS app as the timeseries database to store all of our metrics.

1. In the TrueNAS UI go to ➡️ Apps
1. Click on **Discover Apps**
1. Search for **InfluxDB** and install it
1. In the "Install InfluxDB" screen make these changes:
    1. Network Configuration
        1. WebUI Port
            1. **Port Number**: 8086
    1. Storage Configuration
        1. InfluxDB Config Storage
            1. **Type**: Host Path
            1. **Host Path**: /mnt/Vault/Apps/InfluxDB/config
        1. InfluxDB Data Storage
            1. **Type**: Host Path
            1. **Host Path**: /mnt/Vault/Apps/InfluxDB/data
1. Then click **Install**

```{imgur-figure} 3HBbsW4
After you click "Install" you should see something like this.
```

### Initial Setup

Once the application is "Running" click on it. Under "Application Info" click on **Web UI**. You'll see a "Get Started"
button. Click on it and then fill out the form. Here I've provided some suggested values:

1. **Username**: admin
1. **Initial Organization Name**: homelab
1. **Initial Bucket Name**: telegraf
1. Click **Continue** then **Quick Start**

### Generate Tokens

```{imgur-figure} I7lVJeB
```

Next we need to create a token for Telegraf to use for writing, and another token for Grafana to use for reading. In the web
UI expand the sidebar (there's an icon in the lower left corner) and go to:

- Load Data
    - API Tokens
        - Generate API Token
            - Custom API Token

For Telegraf:

1. **Description**: telegraf-truenas
1. Buckets > telegraf > **Write**: Check
1. Generate
1. Copy the presented token, you won't be able to access it after this

Then repeat the process for Grafana:

1. **Description**: grafana
1. Buckets > telegraf > **Read**: Check
1. Generate
1. Copy the presented token, you won't be able to access it after this

## Telegraf

Most guides and posts on the internet show how to run Telegraf from a Docker container with `/sys` and other filesystems
mounted as well as running in privileged mode. I personally don't like that approach, so instead I just run Telegraf as root
on "bare metal" (as in not in a container or in a VM).

```{warning}
Running Telegraf on bare metal is not officially supported by TrueNAS. This implementation may stop working on future
versions of TrueNAS SCALE if they stop including the commands we need.
```

To get started download three files and save them in `/mnt/Vault/Apps/Telegraf/`:

1. [telegraf.conf](/_static/telegraf.conf) unmodified
1. [telegraf.env](/_static/telegraf.env) with "REPLACE_ME" replaced
    - *Use the telegraf token you generated in the [Generate Tokens](#generate-tokens) section*
1. [telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/releases) from the latest **linux_amd64** release
    - *Extract the tar.gz file and look for the `telegraf` file in `usr/bin`*

:::{hint}
If you run `ls -lah /mnt/Vault/Apps/Telegraf` you should see something like this:

```
total 120M
drwxrwx--- 2 root          root    5 Aug 31 13:37 .
drwxrwx--- 5 root          root    5 Aug 31 12:43 ..
-rwxrwx--- 1 truenas_admin root 284M Aug 31 13:37 telegraf
-rwxrwx--- 1 truenas_admin root 2.2K Aug 31 13:37 telegraf.conf
-rwxrwx--- 1 truenas_admin root  104 Aug 31 13:37 telegraf.env
```
:::

### Run on Boot

Here we'll configure TrueNAS to run Telegraf on boot by using a post-init command. This command will use `systemd-run` to
launch Telegraf and handle things such as logging, restarting on failures, and environment variables.

1. In the TrueNAS UI go to ➡️ System > Advanced Settings
1. Add an Init/Shutdown script
    1. **Description**: Telegraf
    1. **Type**: Command
    1. **When**: Post Init
    1. **Command**:
        ```bash
        /bin/systemd-run --no-block --unit telegraf -p User=root -p Restart=always -p RestartSec=30 -p EnvironmentFile=/mnt/Vault/Apps/Telegraf/telegraf.env /mnt/Vault/Apps/Telegraf/telegraf --config /mnt/Vault/Apps/Telegraf/telegraf.conf
        ```

You can now reboot, or if you don't want to you can run the command with `sudo`.

```{tip}
To view Telegraf logs run: `sudo journalctl -u telegraf`

To stop Telegraf run: `sudo systemctl stop telegraf`
```

### TrueNAS Graphite Exporter

TrueNAS supports exporting some metrics. Here we'll tell it to export them to Telegraf. They're not used in my dashboard but
you might find a use for them.

1. In the TrueNAS UI go to ➡️ Reporting
1. Click on **Exporters** then **Add**
    1. **Name**: Telegraf
    1. **Type**: GRAPHITE
    1. **Destination IP**: localhost
    1. **Destination Port**: 2003
    1. **Prefix**: graphite
    1. **Namespace**: truenas_reporting
    1. **Update Every**: 10
        - *This matches `agent.interval` in [telegraf.conf](/_static/telegraf.conf)*

To confirm this works you can go into the InfluxDB web UI then click on **Data Explorer**:

```{imgur-figure} wA62DJO
You should see a lot of `graphite.*` measurements in the telegraf bucket.
```

### Alerts

I'd like to be notified if InfluxDB isn't recording metrics. We'll accomplish this by reappropriating the built-in
ApplicationsStartFailed alert. Every minute a systemd timer will poll the `outputs.health` endpoint in
[telegraf.conf](/_static/telegraf.conf) and fail if Telegraf isn't running or if Telegraf hasn't been sending metrics to
InfluxDB.

1. In the TrueNAS UI go to ➡️ System > Advanced Settings
1. Add an Init/Shutdown script
    1. **Description**: Telegraf Health
    1. **Type**: Command
    1. **When**: Post Init
    1. **Command**:
        ```bash
        /bin/systemd-run --on-calendar='*:*:00' --unit telegraf-health sh -c 'curl -sSf http://localhost:12121 -o /dev/null || midclt call alert.oneshot_create ApplicationsStartFailed "{\"error\": \"telegraf unhealthy\"}"'
        ```

```{note}
The way Telegraf's health endpoint is implemented is a bit confusing. If Telegraf isn't able to send metrics to InfluxDB,
they pile up in its internal memory buffer. When the number of buffered metrics crosses a threshold (configured in
`outputs.health.compares`) the health endpoint starts responding with an http 503 error (typically 5 minutes after InfluxDB
has gone down). When InfluxDB is restored Telegraf will re-send these buffered metrics and the health check will return to an
http 200 OK state.
```

### Fan Speed

This step is optional and specific to the Beelink ME Mini. Out of the box the CPU fan speed isn't reported because of a
[missing kernel driver](https://github.com/frankcrawford/it87/issues/3). I wrote a workaround that compiles and installs the
driver into TrueNAS to see the current fan RPM in the dashboard.

```{danger}
Do this at your own risk. Custom kernel drivers are 100% not officially supported by TrueNAS.
```

1. In the TrueNAS UI go to ➡️ System > Advanced Settings
1. Add an Init/Shutdown script
    1. **Description**: Telegraf it87
    1. **Type**: Command
    1. **When**: Post Init
    1. **Command**:
        ```bash
        /bin/systemd-run --unit telegraf-it87 -p User=root sh -euxc 'if ! sensors |grep -P "^fan.?:"; then until systemctl is-active docker.service; do sleep 10; done; echo "FROM ubuntu AS build\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git make gcc\nWORKDIR /source\nRUN git clone https://github.com/frankcrawford/it87 .\nCOPY --from=usrlib modules /lib/modules\nCOPY --from=usrlib x86_64-linux-gnu/libelf.so.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/\nCOPY --from=usrsrc . /usr/src\nRUN make\nFROM scratch\nCOPY --from=build /source/it87.ko ." |docker build --build-context usrlib=/usr/lib --build-context usrsrc=/usr/src --output=/var/run/it87 -; mount -o remount,rw /usr; cp /var/run/it87/it87.ko "/usr/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/hwmon/"; mount -o remount,ro /usr; echo it87 |tee /etc/modules-load.d/it87.conf; modprobe it87; fi'
        ```

Reboot or run the command with `sudo`.

## Grafana

We can use the offical Grafana TrueNAS app to visualize our metrics and draw pretty graphs. It also supports alerting you
through email, Discord, Slack, and other methods (however I won't be covering Grafana alerts in this guide).

1. In the TrueNAS UI go to ➡️ Apps
1. Click on **Discover Apps**
1. Search for **Grafana** and install it
1. In the "Install Grafana" screen make these changes:
    1. Storage Configuration
        1. Grafana Data Storage
            1. **Type**: Host Path
            1. **Host Path**: /mnt/Vault/Apps/Grafana/data
        1. Grafana Plugins Storage
            1. **Type**: Host Path
            1. **Host Path**: /mnt/Vault/Apps/Grafana/plugins

```{imgur-figure} qbXRRCO
TODO UPDATE IMAGE. After you click "Install" you should see something like this.
```

### Grafana Configuration

Once the application is "Running" click on it. Under "Application Info" click on **Web UI**. The default username and
password are both "admin". Click on the Grafana logo in the upper left corner and then do the following to set it up with our
InfluxDB application:

1. Connections > Data sources > Add data source > InfluxDB
    1. **Name**: influxdb
    1. **Query language**: Flux
    1. **URL**: `http://172.16.0.1:8086`
        - *This is the Docker network IP that InfluxDB runs in*
    1. **Auth**: *Disable all*
    1. InfluxDB Details
        1. **Organization**: homelab
        1. **Token**: *Use the grafana token you generated in the [Generate Tokens](#generate-tokens) section*
        1. **Default Bucket**: telegraf
    1. Save & test
        - *It should say something like: TODO*

You can now create a new dashboard or import mine and go from there. To import mine:

1. Dashboards > New > Import
    1. Upload my [grafana.json](/_static/grafana.json)
    1. influxdb > **Select a InfluxDB data source**: influxdb
    1. **NAS_HOST**: *your NAS hostname*
        - *Find this hostname in the main Dashboard page of the TrueNAS UI, under System Information*
    1. Import

I like to make this dashboard the default page for Grafana, so when I click on "Web UI" it takes me directly to the graphs.

1. Upper right avatar > Profile > Preferences
    1. **Home Dashboard**: Dashboards/NAS
    1. Save

## Conclusion

You should now have the "TIG stack" running on your NAS. Feel free to add or remove panels in the dashboard to see the
metrics you're interested in. You can also monitor additional components of your homelab by editing the `telegraf.conf` file.
