# Desk Photos 2007

## February: Work @ Symantec

I shared this office with my coworker while I was a contractor at Symantec.

## July

Living in my second apartment in Austin, before moving into my third apartment.  This was the first new monitor I bought since 2001.

## August

Right before and after moving to my third apartment, right after buying my second monitor. When I saw these two monitors at work I knew I had to have them, so I bought them brand new on Craigslist for like half the price.
