# Home Desk 2003-03

Started by a thread called “Where You Rock” on Big-O-Software Forums in early 2003, I began to take pictures of my desk to
show off. Since then I have tried to take pictures of all my desks after significant changes for nostalgic purposes.

My desk soon after I moved. This was back when I was hosting my website on a 486 running Windows 98 SE, which was super slow.
