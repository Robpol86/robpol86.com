# Desk Photos 2003

Started by a thread called “Where You Rock” on Big-O-Software Forums in early 2003, I began to take pictures of my desk to
show off. Since then I have tried to take pictures of all my desks after significant changes for nostalgic purposes.

## March

My desk soon after I moved. This was back when I was hosting my website on a 486 running Windows 98 SE, which was super slow.

## May

Not much different from the March picture other than I ditched Windows for my web server and installed Red Hat 9! I credit my entire career on this change. I compiled MySQL, Apache, and PHP from source (MySQL took literally over 24 hours to compile) and learned the Linux command line along with the basics of PHP and computer science during my free time.
