# Dell Rack 2012

After over a whole year since receiving it I have finally made full use of my rack and transferred all of my computers and equipment to it.

    On this side I only wired audio from the KVM and CATV.

    I routed almost all cables on this side. Ethernet, power to the rear power strip, USB, video, etc.

    Here you can see the two ethernet surge protectors as well as my attempted cable management.

    Zip tied to the underside of the shelf I have my Obi202 box. It let me hook up my fax printer and landline telephone to it to two Google Voice numbers. All free!

    I tried to make it easy to disconnect my rack and move it out of its corner without having to undo all of my wiring.

    This looked better in my mind before implementing it.

    I made sure there was enough slack in the "umbilical cord" to allow my desk to go all the way down, to avoid any accidents.

    The white things are the antennas for my desktop's WiFi/bluetooth adapter built into my motherboard.

    This Buffalo 802.11ac wireless router was a piece of crap.
