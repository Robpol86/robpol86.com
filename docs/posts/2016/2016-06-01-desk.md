# Desk Photos 2016

## June: Work @ Uber

Right before I moved desks for the 6th time in 1.5 years. I lost my nice window desk, oh well.

## October: Work @ Uber

Looks the same right? Talk about consistency! However this is another desk at the other side of the office, though on the same floor. This was my last desk at Uber before I left the company four months after this picture was taken.
