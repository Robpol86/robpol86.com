# Snapmaker 2.0 A350T Teflon Tube

```{tags} 3d-printing
```

I recently upgraded from my cheap and finicky [Monoprice 3D printer](../../3d_printer_mpms2.md) to an expensive and versatile
one (it WAS the latest and greatest [for a few weeks ðŸ˜­](https://snapmaker.com/snapmaker-artisan)). After using it for a few
times I already got the modding itch.

This project was inspired by [Tech Centric's video post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lo55eJFlio). I took care of some
cable management (I didn't like the cables rubbing against the enclosure or touching the hot platform) and used a teflon tube
to stop the filament from getting caught on the vertical posts when the print head moves from home (which is at the very top)
down to the platform before every print.

Before and After

My newly rewired 9U server rack cabinet hidden in my living room.

Bottom Cable Management

I didn't want any of the cables dragging on the table under the printer to avoid any snagging when moving this heavy printer.
I accomplished this with plety of zip ties and rotating the CAN hub by 90 degrees. I also eliminated any slack with the
heated platform cable so it no longer touches the platform itself.

Stop Button

The cable for the stop button with enclosures is super long. Instead I used the much shorter cable meant for non-enclosed
printers, and I did not route it through the power cable cut out near the bottom of the printer.

Rear Cable Management

Wrapped the fan cable around the fan itself. No more slack anywhere!

Thread Tapping

This is the fun part. Instead of 3d printing a new print head cover with threads for the teflon tube fitting I ended up
tapping the original metal cover with M6 threads. I set my power drill to low-speed-high-torque mode (number 1 on the drill's
top switch) and used the drill bit that came with the tap and die set to expand the center hole. Then I used the M6 tap with
the same drill and slowly carved the threads. I was super surprised at the results!

Head Fitting

Next I installed my trusty old 10 gig switch. I'm super excited that Google Fiber sent me a router with an SFP module that I
could plug directly into my switch, it's basically a "modem" on a stick! For those that are curious this only runs at 1 Gbps
speeds so I'm currently just paying for Google's 1 gigabit service instead of their 2 gig offering.

Tube

Another thing I'm excited about is that I managed to finally find some slide rails small enough to fit in my shallow-depth
rack. I got rid of my old shelf and have now properly racked my dual mini-ITX 2U server chassis. I made sure the network and
power cables have enough slack so I can fully extend the server without having to power it down.

Lastly I plugged in the two 5V Noctua fans into those USB power adapters. I don't want anything to overheat and it does
indeed get a bit warm in there what with my 6 spinning hard drives.
