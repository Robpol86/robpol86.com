# Snapmaker 2.0 A350T Teflon Tube

```{tags} 3d-printing
```

I recently upgraded from my cheap and finicky [Monoprice 3D printer](../../3d_printer_mpms2.md) to an expensive and versatile
one (it WAS the latest and greatest [for a few weeks ðŸ˜­](https://snapmaker.com/snapmaker-artisan)). After using it for a few
times I already got the modding itch.

This post was inspired by [Tech Centric's video post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lo55eJFlio). I took care of some cable
management (I didn't like the cables rubbing against the enclosure or touching the hot platform) and used a teflon tube to
stop the filament from getting caught on the vertical posts when the print head moves from home (which is at the very top)
down to the platform before every print.

Drilling Three Holes

I had to drill additional holes near the bend on my custom designed rack posts to keep them flush against the TV cabinet
walls. Easier, faster, and cheaper than updating my design and having new ones fabricated.

Wiring First

Crimped custom-length CAT6 cables and got lucky with 1 meter long fiber cables. The yellow fiber cable is for my Google Fiber
internet service and the blue fiber cable goes to my office on the other side of the wall.

Installed UPS

Next I installed my UPS with some right-angle power adapters. The two USB power adapters are for the TV cabinet ventilation
fans. Two fans and two power adapters for redundancy in case one is defective. The white USB cable going out of the cabinet
is for a Nest camera.

Installed PDU

Here I installed a PDU at the top of the rear posts with my UniFi PoE injector zipped tied to it. I made some magnetic labels
for my patch panel and 3d printed a magnetic door stop, though it's falling apart after a couple of years of adding and
removing it lol.

Installed Switch

Next I installed my trusty old 10 gig switch. I'm super excited that Google Fiber sent me a router with an SFP module that I
could plug directly into my switch, it's basically a "modem" on a stick! For those that are curious this only runs at 1 Gbps
speeds so I'm currently just paying for Google's 1 gigabit service instead of their 2 gig offering.

Installed Dual Server

Another thing I'm excited about is that I managed to finally find some slide rails small enough to fit in my shallow-depth
rack. I got rid of my old shelf and have now properly racked my dual mini-ITX 2U server chassis. I made sure the network and
power cables have enough slack so I can fully extend the server without having to power it down.

Rear Panel and Fan Assembly

Lastly I plugged in the two 5V Noctua fans into those USB power adapters. I don't want anything to overheat and it does
indeed get a bit warm in there what with my 6 spinning hard drives.

In All Its Glory

In the future I may add another 2U case.

Center I/O

I added a keystone surface mount box to make plugging and unplugging wires easy, in case I rearrange my living room or
something. The dark blue CAT6 cable goes to the garage for one of my UniFi access points, the light blue LC/UPC fiber cable
goes to a switch in my office and the gray CAT5e cable goes up to my Chromecast behind the TV. The power strip is also for my
TV and game consoles.

Here's what the back looks like. More keystones!

VLAN Configuration

This is how I configured the VLANs on my Netgear switch. So glad I took the Cisco CCNA class in high school.
