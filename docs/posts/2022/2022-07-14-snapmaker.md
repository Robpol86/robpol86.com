# Snapmaker 2.0 A350T Teflon Tube

```{tags} 3d-printing
```

I recently upgraded from my cheap and finicky [Monoprice 3D printer](../../3d_printer_mpms2.md) to an expensive and versatile
one (it WAS the latest and greatest [for a few weeks ðŸ˜­](https://snapmaker.com/snapmaker-artisan)). After using it for a few
times I already got the modding itch.

This project was inspired by [Tech Centric's video post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lo55eJFlio). I took care of some
cable management (I didn't like the cables rubbing against the enclosure or touching the hot platform) and used a teflon tube
to stop the filament from getting caught on the vertical posts when the print head moves from home (which is at the very top)
down to the platform before every print.

Before and After

Bottom Cable Management

I didn't want any of the cables dragging on the table under the printer to avoid any snagging when moving this heavy printer.
I accomplished this with plety of zip ties and rotating the CAN hub by 90 degrees. I also eliminated any slack with the
heated platform cable so it no longer touches the platform itself.

Stop Button

The cable for the stop button with enclosures is super long. Instead I used the much shorter cable meant for non-enclosed
printers, and I did not route it through the power cable cut out near the bottom of the printer.

Rear Cable Management

Wrapped the fan cable around the fan itself. No more slack anywhere!

Thread Tapping

This is the fun part. Instead of 3d printing a new print head cover with threads for the teflon tube fitting I ended up
tapping the original metal cover with M6 threads. I set my power drill to low-speed-high-torque mode (number 1 on the drill's
top switch) and used the drill bit that came with the tap and die set to expand the center hole. Then I used the M6 tap with
the same drill and slowly carved the threads. I was super surprised at the results!

Head Fitting

The PTFE teflon tubing kit I bought came with teflon tubes and two types of push-in fittings. The blue fittings prevent the
teflon tube from going all the way through.

Teflon Tube

The black fitting that comes with the kit allows the teflon tube to push through but keeps it in place during normal usage.
It turns out these fittings are the perfect size. It easily screws into the plastic snap bushing that came with the enclosure
so I didn't need to drill or tap anything for this one.

UPS

I have my 3D printer on a UPS in case there are any brownouts or blackouts to avoid interrupting long prints. Though if I
would buy a UPS again I would get a bigger one with more run time.
