# OEMTools 24938 Gauge Mod

I change my own oil using the [extraction method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RakLAZIRgwU). Since my oil filter is
accessible from the the top of the engine bay there's no need for me to get under the car for oil changes. One of my gripes
about this method was that I didn't know how much pumping I had to do to keep the oil flowing.

My solution was to replace the pneumatic valve (which I don't plan on using) with a vacuum pressure gauge. Having just
changed my oil with it I can say it's super handy and I'm glad I did this mod! I discovered that I only had to do some
pumping at the beginning and once more in the middle of the extraction. Before the gauge I kept pumping it every couple of
minutes since I didn't know what was going on.

I also got a gas can spout for this particular extractor to make dumping the oil out of it a breeze. I didn't spill a single
drop when transferring the old oil from the extractor back into the 5 qt oil jug.

    Unscrew the lid collar and pop off the lid. This is the underside, held in place with a Bessey vise.

    Install the Gauge

    Screw together the gauge, the 45 degree elbow, and the bulkhead coupler. Then install the assembly with the nut that came
    with the coupler. I didn't need to use any teflon tape or sealant for any of the couplings.

    First Use

    I pumped it to -20 inHg to start the oil flowing. It held that vacuum very well, and I only had to pump it back to -20 once
    more before all the oil was sucked out.

    Graduated Cylinder

    Before the first use I used water to manually measure and mark the container in quarts. I scored the plastic with a blade
    so I can re-mark it with a sharpie once the ink wears off over time. And yes, I pulled out 7 quarts of oil from my MK7 VW
    instead of 6. I overfilled it a bit on my last oil change, oops lol.

    Gas Can Spout

    Turns out the gas can spout I bought on Amazon is a perfect fit. This made pouring the used oil into the spent containers
    very clean and easy! The ring cap that comes with the extractor is meant only to help push out the hose but it turns out it
    can also hold the spout in place. I flipped the spout up after dispensing some of it to prevent oil from dribbling out.
