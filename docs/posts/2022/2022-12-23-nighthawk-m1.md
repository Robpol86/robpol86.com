# Netgear Nighthawk M1 Hacking

```{tags} hacking, hotspot
```

I'm replacing my old [T-Mobile Franklin T9](../../franklin_t9) with a more capable hotspot. The
[Netgear Nighthawk M1](https://www.netgear.com/home/mobile-wifi/hotspots/mr1100/) is easy to root, supports USB and microSD
cards for storage (with a caveat that this is disabled when USB tethering is enabled), has a lot more RAM (relatively
speaking), and works fine with [Google Fi](https://fi.google.com/about).

## Telnet and Root

The first step is to gain root access. I fully updated my device first and ended up with `NTG9X50C_12.06.39.00` as the
firmware version.
