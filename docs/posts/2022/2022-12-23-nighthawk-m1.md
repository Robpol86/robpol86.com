# Netgear Nighthawk M1 Hacking

```{tags} hacking, hotspot
```

I'm replacing my old [T-Mobile Franklin T9](../../franklin_t9) with a more capable hotspot. The
[Netgear Nighthawk M1](https://www.netgear.com/home/mobile-wifi/hotspots/mr1100/) is easy to root, supports USB and microSD
cards for storage, has a lot more RAM (relatively speaking), and works fine with [Google Fi](https://fi.google.com/about).
