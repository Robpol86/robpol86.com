# HomeLink Rearview Mirror

```{thumb-figure} /_images/pictures/alltrack/homelink/6-installed.gif
:no-resize:
```

My 2019 Golf Alltrack SE came with an auto-dimming mirror, but I wanted the one with garage door buttons integrated in it.
Since my car had the rain sensor option installed I already had power available to my mirror, so this upgrade was super easy
to do. No coding was required.

Parts needed:

* [Enhanced Rearview Mirror with HomeLink 000072548F](https://parts.vw.com/p/Volkswagen_2019_Alltrack-SE-Wagon-18L-MT/Enhanced-Rearview-Mirror-with-HomeLink/68023762/000072548F.html)
  * I bought this "F" version but I think I could have gotten the "B" version instead since I did not need to use the
    wiring harness that it came with.
  * $218.02 when I purchased it on 2021-12-24

Instructions and other resources used:

The compass in the mirror seemed to self-calibrate after I drove around for a bit.

    New mirror connector is nearly the same as my factory one except some pins are in different positions. Worked fine though.

    Remove this black plastic trim by wedging a trim removal tool in the bottom center to split the two pieces apart. Do it
    gently, I broke the middle clip doing this (picture of clips is from a spare I bought, part numbers 3G0-858-633-82V and
    3G0-858-634-82V).

    Original mirror with the trim removed. To remove the mirror you just need to twist it counter-clockwise (towards the driver
    side).

    The new mirror. I run my dashcam wires through the mirror's metal base to avoid having the wires tear up my headliner in case
    somebody tries to steal it by pulling hard on it.
