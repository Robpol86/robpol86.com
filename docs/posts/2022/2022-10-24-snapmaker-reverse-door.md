# Snapmaker Enclosure Door Reversal

```{tags} 3d-printing
```

I moved my Snapmaker 2.0 A350T recently. The official enclosure has a solid panel on the right side and a large door on the
left. It also has a smaller door on the front. This post is how I went about swapping the solid panel and large door around.
Sadly the enclosure is only engineered to have the large door on the right so there are a couple of minor drawbacks to this
"mod". Overall I feel that the pros outweigh the cons.

## TLDR

Steps:

1. Remove all plexiglass panels and doors.
2. Remove the rear top (with the converter hub) and bottom 24 BEAM A350-4 rails.
3. Measure the offsets of the foot fixture indentations on the bottom rails (my enclosure measured 123 mm offset).
4. Facing front to back flip the entire enclosure 180 degrees (e.g. top is now on the bottom).
5. Relocate the LED strips from the bottom back to the top rails (tiny screws won't be needed anymore).
6. Flip the hall sensor 180 degrees.
7. For the foot fixtures insert two M4 2020 slide-in T-nuts into each bottom rail.
8. Mark on the now bottom rails the foot fixture offsets.
9. Reinstall the rear rails, keeping the one with the converter hub at the top.
10. Install the doors. Flip the small-door panel with the touchscreen cutout.
11. Put some 10 mm wide 3 mm thick self-adhesive weather stripping on the flipped panel.

Drawbacks:

* The LED strips were held firmly in place by two small screws each originally. They'll be loose now but there's little play
  and won't really be a problem when the enclosure is fully reassembled.
* The bottom rails have indentations so the foot fixtures can be installed precisely. Originally there is very little space
  between the movable platform and the front of the enclosure when the Y-axis is at it's maximum. It's up to you to mark the
  offsets correctly and verify the platform won't collide with the enclosure on max Y. You should also verify the enclosure
  can't be pushed towards the printer causing a collision mid-print (by making sure the foot fixture screws are tightened).
* The touchscreen will now be on the left side at the front, so the cord will be extended as it crosses diagonally towards
  the main hub on the right side of the printer.
* I bought the emergency stop button, so I don't know if the spare M4 2020 slide-in T-nuts I have came from that or from the
  enclosure.
* The top panel's screw holes will only align with the shorter front/back rails. You can optionally drill holes into the
  panel or buy additional T-nuts for the long rails.
