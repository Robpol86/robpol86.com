## TLDR

* Remove rear top and bottom rails
* Flip everything around 180 degrees
* Relocate (now bottom) LEDs to new top
* Flip hall sensor 180 degrees. use zip tie trick for loose plastic washers
* Insert four 45 degree nuts for the foot fixtures (I had to add 1.3mm washers)
* Reinstall rear rails
* Flip doors and install
* Flip cut-out panel and install foam on the other side (optionally remove original foam) use 10mmx3mm strips
