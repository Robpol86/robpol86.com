# Snapmaker Enclosure Door Reversal

```{tags} 3d-printing
```

I moved my Snapmaker 2.0 A350T recently. The official enclosure has a solid panel on the right side and a large door on the
left. It also has a smaller door on the front. This post is how I went about swapping the solid panel and large door around.
Sadly the enclosure is only engineered to have the large door on the right so there are a couple of minor drawbacks to this
"mod". Overall I feel that the pros outweigh the cons.

## TLDR

Steps:

* Remove rear top and bottom rails
* Flip everything around 180 degrees
* Relocate (now bottom) LEDs to new top
* Flip hall sensor 180 degrees. use zip tie trick for loose plastic washers
* Insert four 45 degree nuts for the foot fixtures (I had to add 1.3mm washers)
* Reinstall rear rails
* Flip doors and install
* Flip cut-out panel and install foam on the other side (optionally remove original foam) use 10mmx3mm strips

Drawbacks:

* TODO
