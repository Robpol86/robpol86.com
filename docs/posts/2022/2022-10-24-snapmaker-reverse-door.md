# Snapmaker Enclosure Door Reversal

```{tags} 3d-printing

I moved my Snapmaker 2.0 A350T recently. The official enclosure has a solid panel on the right side and a large door on the
left. It also has a smaller door on the front. This post is how I went about swapping the solid panel and large door around.
Sadly the enclosure is only engineered to have the large door on the right so there are a couple of minor drawbacks to this
"mod". Overall I feel that the pros outweigh the cons.

## TLDR

Steps:

1. Remove all plexiglass panels and doors.
2. Remove the rear top rail (TODO, with the converter hub) and the rear bottom rail (TODO).
3. Measure the offsets for the ... TODO
4. Facing front to back flip the entire enclosure 180 degrees (e.g. top is now on the bottom).
5. Relocate the LED strips from the bottom back to the top rails (tiny screws won't be needed anymore).
6. Flip the hall sensor 180 degrees.
7. For the foot fixtures insert two M4 T-Nuts into each bottom rail (I also had to use 1.3 mm washers).
8. Reinstall the rear rails, keeping the one with the converter hub at the top.
9. Install the doors. Flip the small-door panel with the touchscreen cutout.
10. Put some 10 mm wide 3 mm thick self-adhesive weather stripping on the flipped panel.

Drawbacks:
