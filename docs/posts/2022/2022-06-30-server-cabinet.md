Drilling Three Holes

I had to drill additional holes near the bend on my custom designed rack posts to keep them flush against the TV cabient
walls. Easier, faster, and cheaper than updating my design and having new ones fabricated.

Wiring First

Crimped custom-length CAT6 cables and got lucky with 1 meter long fiber cables. The yellow fiber cable is for my Google Fiber
internet service and the blue fiber cable goes to my office on the other side of the wall.

Installed UPS

Next I installed my UPS with some right-angle power adapters. The two USB power adapters are for the TV cabinet ventilation
fans. Two fans and two power adapters for redundancy in case one is defective.
