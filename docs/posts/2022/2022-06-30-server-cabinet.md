New mirror connector is nearly the same as my factory one except some pins are in different positions. Worked fine though.

Remove this black plastic trim by wedging a trim removal tool in the bottom center to split the two pieces apart. Do it
gently, I broke the middle clip doing this (picture of clips is from a spare I bought, part numbers 3G0-858-633-82V and
3G0-858-634-82V).

Original mirror with the trim removed. To remove the mirror you just need to twist it counter-clockwise (towards the driver
side).

The new mirror. I run my dashcam wires through the mirror's metal base to avoid having the wires tear up my headliner in case
somebody tries to steal it by pulling hard on it.
