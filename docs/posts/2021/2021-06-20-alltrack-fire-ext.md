# Fire Extinguisher

Bought a rechargeable 2.5 lb fire extinguisher from Amazon:
[Amerex Dry Chemical Fire Extinguisher B417T](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VXRYCM)

I then zip tied it to my car placing some velcro around the fire extinguisher, so it's easy to pull out during an emergency.
It stays put after driving for weeks and doesn't get in the way of lifting the cover to access my spare tire.

## Oct &#39;21 Update

Every now and then the fire extinguisher would move a bit, getting in the way of the bottom cover/floor. I fixed this by
using some zip ties to hold the extinguisher in place. I made sure it's still easy to remove during an emergency, just slide
off the zip tie with my thumb.
