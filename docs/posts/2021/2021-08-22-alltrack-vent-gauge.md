# P3 Vent Gauge

Installed this to have a boost gauge in my air vent:
[P3 V3 OBD2 - VW Mk7 / Mk7.5 Gauge (2014-2020)](https://www.p3cars.com/volkswagen/p3-v3-obd2-vw-mk7-mk7-5-gauge-2014-2019/)

I didn't bother hooking up the dimmer wire since you can dim it manually by holding the right button. I mounted the
controller box using zip ties (it's on tight and doesn't move at all) and I heatshrinked the unused wires to avoid any
potential shorts.
