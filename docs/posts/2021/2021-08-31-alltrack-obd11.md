# OBDeleven

These modifications are done with an [OBDeleven](https://obdeleven.com) device.

## Refuel Quantity

Adds a screen in my MFD where the car estimates how much fuel it would take to fill the tank. Handy for when I have to
prepay with cash at gas stations.

* Apps > Refuel quantity in dashboard > ON

## Automatic DST

Instead of having to toggle DST manually the car does it automatically.
