# Rack Cabinet 2011-06-10

Right after I took all of this equipment home. Dell PowerEdge Rack Enclosure 2410, Dell PowerVault 124T LTO3 Autoloader, and
APC SUA2200RM2U. I put my Linux file server in it on top of a shelf too.

    I removed all of the panels and cleaned it up by hand. It was pretty dusty since it was in service for many years. I
    cleaned up the autoloader too. I actually scored TWO of these racks and TWO (!!) of these autoloaders. Both racks had
    broken panels so I put the best parts on mine and gave away the other rack with some broken panels. I also gave away the
    other autoloader since I was told it didn't work and I didn't really need two of these.

    I got a couple of shelves from work (they were throwing everything away since the lab was closing and the office was
    shrinking) as well as a 10/100 Cisco switch. I had to give back the switch :(

    Finished reassembling the rack. That's my HP LaserJet 2200tn I bought from eBay. I liked the ones at my High School so I
    bought a used one. It worked fine and never jammed. The toner cartridge lasted like 5 years.

    I tried to make the most out of my rack and put my file server in it. I also put my WRT54G router running DD-WRT (or
    Tomato? I forget) and my cable modem in it, along with my VoIP box. I ran phone and ethernet cabling to the opposite
    corner of the study to where my computer was.
