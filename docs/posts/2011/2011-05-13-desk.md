# Desk Photos 2011

## May: Work @ Symantec

The same cubicle shortly before another office downsize.

## June

My new GeekDesk Max desk! I finally got rid of that pos corner desk I've had for so long.

    My temporary cubicle during the office downsizing. Unfortunately where my previous cubicle was, they were building a wall right down the middle, so I had to move TWICE during the downsizing.

    After the office downsizing. It's a little bit smaller than my previous cube, but I like it. A benefit of having a standing desk means I can put more stuff underneath it.
