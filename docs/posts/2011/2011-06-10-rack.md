# Dell Rack 2011

Ever since I took a Cisco CCNA class back in high school in 2002 I've always wanted a rack at home. I even bought one on
Craigslist in 2007 for $100 but it had round holes and it was very shallow. Turns out it was meant for music equipment.

Eventually I came across this one back at Symantec as they were about to throw it away once our lab was shut down. I
also scored that tape autoloader and 2200VA UPS, and over $500 worth of brand new, never used, still shrink wrapped
LTO-3 tapes. They were in a garbage bin!

Right after I took all of this equipment home. Dell PowerEdge Rack Enclosure 2410, Dell PowerVault 124T LTO3 Autoloader, and APC SUA2200RM2U. I put my Linux file server in it on top of a shelf too.

    I removed all of the panels and cleaned it up by hand. It was pretty dusty since it was in service for many years. I cleaned up the autoloader too. I actually scored TWO of these racks and TWO (!!) of these autoloaders. Both racks had broken panels so I put the best parts on mine and gave away the other rack with some broken panels. I also gave away the other autoloader since I was told it didn't work and I didn't really need two of these.

    I got a couple of shelves from work (they were throwing everything away since the lab was closing and the office was shrinking) as well as a 10/100 Cisco switch. I had to give back the switch :(

    Finished reassembling the rack. That's my HP LaserJet 2200tn I bought from eBay. I liked the ones at my High School so I bought a used one. It worked fine and never jammed. The toner cartridge lasted like 5 years.

    I tried to make the most out of my rack and put my file server in it. I also put my WRT54G router running DD-WRT (or Tomato? I forget) and my cable modem in it, along with my VoIP box. I ran phone and ethernet cabling to the opposite corner of the study to where my computer was.
