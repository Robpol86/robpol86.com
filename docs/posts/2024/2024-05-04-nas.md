# Travel NAS 2024

Last year I made up my mind to move away from Austin and sell all of my belongings, though I swear I'm not a minimalist. This
included my homelab, or lack thereof. However I still wanted to keep my data with me and ruled out cloud storage or a simple
portable hard drive. I wanted a portable NAS for resilliency and I've grown to like TrueNAS.

I searched for weeks for a NAS I could buy that had the following features:

* 2.5 GbE ethernet
* Eight 2.5" drive bays
* Ability to plug in a 3.5" drive for backing up
* Run TrueNAS instead of a propriatery OS or propriatery filesystem
* Worldwide power support

I looked at different NAS offerings of different brands but none had all of the features I was looking for so I decided to
build a custom travel NAS. The plan was to build a NAS that I could pack in a suitcase, with 2.5 GbE ethernet and 8 2.5"
drives.

## Custom Lid

While the M.2 SATA adapter works fine with the G3, and all 8 disks show up on TrueNAS with proper serial numbers, the connectors protrude too much for the original lid to be used. An even bigger problem is with the M.2 adapter: it's flimsy and the form factor is not designed for the forces used when plugging in and unplugging the SFF-8087 cables. The instructions that came with the M.2 adapter state that you should remove the adapter from the PC before attempting to plug or unplug any cable. This works fine if you don't mind running the mini PC without a lid.
