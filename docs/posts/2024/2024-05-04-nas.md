# Travel NAS 2024

```

Last year I made up my mind to move away from Austin and sell all of my belongings, though I swear I'm not a minimalist. This
included my homelab. However I still wanted to keep my data with me and ruled out cloud storage or a simple portable hard
drive. I wanted a portable NAS for resilliency and I've grown to like TrueNAS.

I searched for weeks for a NAS I could buy that had the following features:

* 2.5 GbE ethernet
* Eight 2.5" drive bays
* Ability to plug in a 3.5" drive for backing up
* Run TrueNAS instead of a propriatery OS or propriatery filesystem
* Worldwide power support

I looked at different NAS offerings of different brands but none had all of the features I was looking for so I decided to
build a custom travel NAS. The plan was to build a NAS that I could pack in a suitcase, with 2.5 GbE ethernet and 8 2.5"
drives.

## Items Used

* [GMKtec G3 Barebone](https://www.gmktec.com/products/nucbox-g3-most-cost-effective-mini-pc-with-intel-n100-processor)

* [Kingston 32GB 3200MHz DDR4 Non-ECC KVR32S22D8/32](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08K5H4HBQ)
* [KingSpec 128GB 2242 SATA III 6Gbps M.2 SSD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CJF384F) as the OS drive
* [LONRIONSAS Mini SAS SFF-8087 Right Angle to 4x SATA](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805635452399.html)

## Custom Lid

```

While the M.2 SATA adapter works fine with the G3, and all 8 disks show up on TrueNAS with proper serial numbers, the
connectors protrude too much for the original lid to be used. An even bigger problem is with the M.2 adapter: it's flimsy and
the form factor is not designed for the forces used when plugging in and unplugging the SFF-8087 cables. The instructions
that came with the M.2 adapter state that you should remove the adapter from the PC before attempting to plug or unplug any
cable. This works fine if you don't mind running the mini PC without a lid.

However I wanted to be able to easily and quickly plug and unplig the SFF cables. I designed a custom lid and support bracket
to hold the SATA adapter in place with zero flexing. Great success!

## Performance

When I [posted this project in the TrueNAS subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/truenas/comments/1b51rj2/truenas_on_a_gmktec_g3/)
a lot of commenters said the chipset on the SATA adapter has poor performance and reliability. For for my single-client use
case I don't have many performance issues. When I'm at 90% capacity and try to do multiple simultaneous writes over 2.5 GbE
ethernet I do run into big performance hits, but 99% of the time I get really good throughput. Actually I think most of the
problems are caused by me using a WD Blue SSD.

They also said the chipsets die randomly after some time. So far after months of use everything works fine. I did add little
heatsinks to the chips on the SATA adapter just in case issues are caused by overheating.

## In the Field

Before moving to NYC I did upgrade the SSD enclosure to a Mini SAS connector for less cables/connectors:

* [ICY DOCK 8x2.5 SAS/SATA 2xMini-SAS MB998IP-B](https://www.amazon.com/ICY-DOCK-MB998IP-B-SATA-Backplane/dp/B07G46V2C5)
* [LONRIONSAS Mini SAS SFF-8643 to Right Angle SFF-8087 Cables](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805704953889.html)

## Retirement

After going through several hotels in Asia I started to get tired of packing and unpacking the NAS. I ended up migrating to
an all NVMe NAS. Other than the annoyance of packing the GMKtec NAS never let me down.

```{list-table}

    The NAS took up most of the space inside my backpack.

    I had to pack it in three separate padded bags.

    I included all the cables in the padded bags but I still broke one of the SFF cables. Still worked though.
