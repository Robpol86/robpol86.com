# Desk Photo 2004

Got my kickass APC SUA1500 UPS! Weeks after getting it the house had a serious electrical problem and caused a brownout on my computer's circuit. It would have been destroyed if it weren't for my UPS. I also dabbled in the world of iptables and IP masquerading with my Linux router on a floppy.
