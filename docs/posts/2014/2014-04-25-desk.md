## April: Work @ Twitter

Got back to having a standing desk. I stole this rolling desk since they moved us to a really cramped area and damned if I'm giving up one of my monitors.

## August

For the first time in my life I bought a pre-built computer (been custom building them since 2000). Also for the first time in my life I bought a Mac.
