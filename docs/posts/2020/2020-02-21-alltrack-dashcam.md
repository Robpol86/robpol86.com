# Front Dashcam Pair

```{imgur-figure} 9dVe8pY
:width: 100%
```

I installed a BlackVue dashcam along with multiple batteries to get about 2 days of recording time while my vehicle is
parked. I live in San Francisco and while my car is parked overnight in a garage, I occasionally park my car in the street
and after a year nobody has broken in to steal the camera.

As a precaution I bought the tamper-proof case so a thief can't just pull out the wires and take the camera. Additionally I
zip tied the wires tightly to the internal metal part of my rearview mirror (and threaded it through a narrow hole for more
strength). Hopefully this means anyone that wants to steal the camera will need to bring a knife or scissors along, and I'm
hoping those are the minority of opportunistic thieves in the city.

```{note}
I suggest covering up unused ports on the BlackVue battery with electrical tape. When I was unplugging and plugging in wires
I accidentally plugged the input power cable in the expansion port of the main battery, sending 12v from the battery back to
my car. Luckily nothing broke but I kept getting ABS errors until I figured out my mistake.

I first installed just the two cameras in the front and wired them to the batteries in my cargo area. For now I didn't wire
the batteries to my fuse panel, using the rear 12v outlet instead.

## Hardwire Batteries

Once I was happy with the cameras I finished the project by hardwiring the batteries to my fuse box. I used the included fuse
taps and I used **15 amp** fuses. In the photos below you'll see two pairs of wires from my fusebox. I ran a second wire from
a second tapped fuse since I may add a second pair of cameras in the future. I tapped
[fuse 48 and 36](https://fuse-box.info/volkswagen/volkswagen-golf-vii-mk7-2013-2020-fuses). These are switched fuses so when
the ignition is off they'll lose power and prevent the BlackVue battery from draining my car's battery when parked.
