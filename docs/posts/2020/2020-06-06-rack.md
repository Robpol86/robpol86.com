# Custom Fabricated Rack 2020

Having my equipment hidden in a TV cabinet was all fine and well but after a while I got the server rack itch. So during the pandemic I learned Fusion 360 and made my own custom 10u rack posts. It turned out nicer than I expected! 3D models are available here: https://github.com/Robpol86/TV-Cabinet-Rack-Posts

    This is my fully loaded rack cabinet. Later on I'll add sliding rails and get rid of the drawer and shelf. From top to bottom: Patch panel with magnetic labels and a 3D printed magnetic door stop; Netgear XS716T 10GbE switch; Server with Supermicro X10SDV-TLN4F running GitLab CI; Travla T2241 dual Mini-ITX case with two X10SDV for pfSense and my general purpose 6x10TB server; APC SMT1500RM2U 1440VA UPS mounted on Tripp Lite UPS rails

    I spent the first two months of the pandemic learning Fusion 360 to design 10u rack posts that fit inside of my Standout Designs Majestic EX 70-inch TV cabinet. I printed out tens of prototypes with my old $300 3D printer and a whole spool of PLA filament. This really ended up paying off during fabrication.

    After making sure my 3D prints aligned perfectly I reached out to Protocase to fabricate my design with 2mm stainless steel. In the end I paid $730 for eight posts (including the other side of the TV cabinet in the future). Thanks to 3D printing I didn't need to adjust the design after receiving the first prototype.

    I got a couple of Noctua NF-F12 5V fans on two separate iPhone chargers for redundancy. If both cooling fans stop then the cabinet would overheat very fast and I'd lose all my data again (disk failure from 2003 still haunts me). Not pictured are intake vent holes on the bottom of the cabinet.

    I zip tied my UniFi UAP-AC-HD-US PoE injector and my gigabit internet ONT to my Tripp Lite PDUMH15-6 PDU.

    And this is how my server rack normally looks like.
