# Dell Rack 2015

My server rack cabinet at home. Removed everything from it, cleaned and dusted it, and installed only the things I'm using.

## Pictures

    I routed all of the bulky power cables (UPS and both PDUs) on the underside of the rack, making sure they don't drag on the ground or rub up against the casters. I tied them down with a bunch of zip ties routed through holes.

    Rear of my APC SUA2200RM2U UPS with a CATV coax cable surge protector screwed where the grounding screw usually goes.

    Motorola SurfBoard SB6141 zip tied to a side post. Fits perfectly snug between the post and the cabinet wall.

    This is where the rack will go once it's ready.

    Temporarily mounted all hardware in the rack so I could route and crimp/patch ethernet cables and zip tie them to place. I don't plan on adding or removing anything for over a year (like last time). From the bottom: UPS, Dell PV-124T Tape Autoloader, custom linux server with IPMI, stupid rack mount case for Mac Pro and an 8 TB RAID1 external drive, Onkyo TX-SR608 receiver, unmanaged Netgear 16-port gigabit switch, and a patch panel.

    Another angle showing the WAN, LAN, and power cables that go to the router (which will sit on top of the rack once I put the top panel on).

    With the top panel on here is a shot with my ASUS RT-N66U router and my receiver hooked up with all 7 speakers (5.1 for the TV and the other two go in my bedroom for my Mac Pro using Dual Zone).

    I tried my best to make this neat and tidy but that stupid Mac Pro rack mount case doesn't make it easy.

    Insides of my linux server. Supermicro MBD-X9SCM-F-O (with IPMI), Intel i3-2100, 8 GB of RAM, repurposed overkill 850 watt PSU (Seasonic SS-850KM3), WD3000HLFS hard drive from 2010 that still works. That bluray drive isn't hooked up, I just didn't have any drive bay covers to use.
