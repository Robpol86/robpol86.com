# Desk Photo 2026

## February: Hong Kong

Some hotels give you only a tiny desk. I got tired of these hotels preventing me from using my second monitor so I went and
bought some LEGOs and invented my own monitor stand.

Other notable changes are a new Thunderbolt dock, the Anker Prime TB5 Docking Station. This one is only marginally better
than my last docking station. The biggest difference is the front USB ports no longer lose power when I connect/disconnect my
laptop. It was annoying having to wait a couple of minutes for travel router to reboot when I plugged in my laptop after
being at a coffee shop.

I'm also getting old and started feeling some shoulder pain. The dreaded "mouse shoulder". I switched to a trackball mouse,
the ELECOM DEFT PRO, and that seems to have cured the problem. Out of the box the mouse sucked though. I had to replace the
bearings with some uxcell 2.5mm ceramic ones and because the software for the mouse also sucked I'm using a
[HID Remapper](https://www.remapper.org/) on a custom board to remap mouse buttons to keybindings.

Lastly I got rid of my old Apple folding wireless charger with a 3-in-1 wireless charger. No more lightning cables finally.
