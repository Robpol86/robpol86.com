Photo Albums

Here are several of my random photo albums. As you can see, I am quite fond of taking pictures of my possessions.

=============

Started by a thread called “Where You Rock” on Big-O-Software Forums in early 2003, I began to take pictures of my desk to
show off. Since then I have tried to take pictures of all my desks after significant changes for nostalgic purposes.
