Photo Albums

Here are several of my random photo albums. As you can see, I am quite fond of taking pictures of my possessions.

Desk Pictures
=============

Started by a thread called “Where You Rock” on Big-O-Software Forums in early 2003, I began to take pictures of my desk to
show off. Since then I have tried to take pictures of all my desks after significant changes for nostalgic purposes.

Rack Cabinet
============

Ever since I took a Cisco CCNA class back in high school in 2002 I've always wanted a rack at home. I even bought one on
Craigslist in 2007 for $100 but it had round holes and it was very shallow. Turns out it was meant for music equipment.

Eventually I came across this one back at Symantec as they were about to throw it away once our lab was shut down. I
also scored that tape autoloader and 2200VA UPS, and over $500 worth of brand new, never used, still shrink wrapped
LTO-3 tapes. They were in a garbage bin!

Having my equipment hidden in a TV cabinet was all fine and well but after a while I got the server rack itch. So during the
pandemic I learned Fusion 360 and made my own custom 10u rack posts. It turned out nicer than I expected! 3D models are
available here: https://github.com/Robpol86/TV-Cabinet-Rack-Posts

I replaced my super cool Dell rack recently with a more normal-looking setup in my living room. After countless weeks looking
for the right TV cabinet I finally found one deep enough to house a couple of 2U rackmount cases and a rackmount switch. It
turned out nicer than I had expected! Don't ask me how much all this cost.

My server rack cabinet at home. Built my own router and zip tied a keystone panel so pulling out my rack doesn't involve
disconnecting my speaker wire. Listen to https://youtu.be/WPDZoOKX8ag to hear how much noise this puts out (not really that
much). For pix of the underside look at last year's gallery: http://imgur.com/gallery/hWyW0

My server rack cabinet at home. Removed everything from it, cleaned and dusted it, and installed only the things I'm using.

Taken after finally re-wiring it and setting it up after moving to San Francisco. I only took one photo of it :(

After over a whole year since receiving it I have finally made full use of my rack and transferred all of my computers and
equipment to it.

Right after I took all of this equipment home. Dell PowerEdge Rack Enclosure 2410, Dell PowerVault 124T LTO3 Autoloader, and
APC SUA2200RM2U. I put my Linux file server in it on top of a shelf too.
