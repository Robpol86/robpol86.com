Wireless Charging Car Dock
==========================

So I was tired of having to hold my phone while plugging in a microusb cable after I've docked it in my car. I couldn't
find very many car docks out there with wireless charging, and I read that Nokia's wireless charging car dock didn't
work very well on the Nexus 5.
