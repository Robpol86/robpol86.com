ImageCFG
========

ImageCFG is a utility that probably does a lot of things (I cannot find any official documentation), but the only reason
I use it is to fix old games (UT99 for example) which have problems on multicore/multicpu systems. It does so by
assigning an executable to specific logical CPUs permanently (by modifying the .exe file, so backup the original in case
you want to restore it).
