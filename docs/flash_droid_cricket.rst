==================================
Flashing Motorola Droid to Cricket
==================================

This guide will explain how to flash a Motorola Droid from Verizon to Cricket based on my experiences. The two
(similar) guides I followed had some inconsistencies and confused me until I pieced together clues from other sources.
My guide will explain the exact steps I took to get my Droid working on **Cricket's $55 Android plan**.

I used the following resources for my guide:

* https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=708937
* https://www.whiterabbit.org/android/

After flashing, everything works for me except sending `long SMS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenated_SMS>`_
(multipart texts that require two or more messages to be sent).

* Placing and receiving calls work.
* Writing and receiving normal SMS works (receiving long SMS works).
* Receiving MMS works (sending MMS started working magically after 12 hours).
* Data works fine, including the Market.

This guide will explain how to get a Motorola Droid (US, CDMA, Verizon version; not the GSM Milestone) from Verizon to
Cricket using a new $55/mo Android plan.
