Flashing Motorola Droid to Cricket
==================================

This guide will explain how to flash a Motorola Droid from Verizon to Cricket based on my experiences. The two
(similar) guides I followed had some inconsistencies and confused me until I pieced together clues from other sources.
My guide will explain the exact steps I took to get my Droid working on **Cricket's $55 Android plan**.

I used the following resources for my guide:

* https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=708937
* https://www.whiterabbit.org/android/

After flashing, everything works for me except sending `long SMS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenated_SMS>`_
(multipart texts that require two or more messages to be sent).

* Placing and receiving calls work.
* Writing and receiving normal SMS works (receiving long SMS works).
* Receiving MMS works (sending MMS started working magically after 12 hours).
* Data works fine, including the Market.

This guide will explain how to get a Motorola Droid (US, CDMA, Verizon version; not the GSM Milestone) from Verizon to
Cricket using a new $55/mo Android plan.

Preface
=======

I decided to break my contract with Verizon and incur a $95 ETF to port my number to Google Voice once I discovered I
could make/receive Gvoice calls for free `using a $50 device <http://www.obihai.com/product-primer.html>`_ with my
landline telephones. When I ported my number on Saturday, it took 23.5 hours to finish porting on Sunday. On that day I
called Verizon to get a new phone number, but the representative informed me I will have to wait 7 days to reactivate
my phone without disturbing the porting process. I didn't want to risk losing my number so I decided to just wait a
week.

I checked how much the rate would be on Verizon without a contract (I'm waiting on a Webtop phone with an unlocked
bootloader) thinking it would be the same, but I found out it was $5/mo more than with a contract. Since then, I made
my mind up to move to Cricket while I waited for a phone I liked to come out.

Prerequisites
=============

Software
--------

1. Motorola Droid (US version, not the Milestone), rooted (probably) with SPRecovery (probably).
2. `Drivers for your phone <https://www.motorola.com/consumers/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=bda09ec8009a0210VgnVCM1000008806b00aRCRD>`_.
3. (probably?) `Android SDK <https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html>`_.
4. Unzip this to get 42900.prl: :download:`42900.zip <_static/42900.zip>`
5. `HW VSP Singleport 3.1.2 <http://www.hw-group.com/products/hw_vsp/index_en.html#DOWNLOAD>`_
6. CDMA Workshop 2.7 (google it).
7. QPST 2.7.355 (google it).

Service
-------

You will need an ``MIN`` (Mobile Identification Number) and an ``MDN`` (Mobile Device Number). Your ``MDN`` is your phone
number, from this point on I will refer to it as your **phone number**. In order to obtain these two values, you will
need to already have an account with Cricket. If you already have these two values from Cricket, skip this section.
Otherwise I will explain how to get these numbers by signing up with Cricket before flashing your phone. You will have
to pay for service up front ($55 for the first month, $15 activation, and tax). You can probably do this online but I
went to a local Cricket store.

In order to sign up with Cricket, you will need your ``MEID`` (Mobile Equipment Identifier) from your phone. You can get
your ``MEID`` from Android but it will be the HEX version, and Cricket needs it in DEC. To avoid converting hex to dec,
poweroff your phone and remove the battery. On the label beneath the battery on your phone you will find both HEX and
DEC ``MEID``. You can either write down the DEC ``MEID``, or better yet, take your phone to Cricket so they can scan the
barcode beneath it instead of manually typing the ``MEID``.

Go to the Cricket store with your phone/``MEID`` and ask to sign up for the $55 Android plan. Tell them you will flash
your phone later and all you will need is your phone number and your ``MIN``. When they sign you up, they will print out
a paper with both of these values. Make sure your ``MIN`` and phone number are on it.

When you have your phone number and ``MIN``, continue on to the next section.

NVRAM Items
-----------

Once you have your ``MIN`` and phone number:

1. Generate a **CDMA Workshop 2.7** NVRAM file from here: https://www.whiterabbit.org/android/
2. Where it says **Enter your login string**: enter **0000000000@mycricket.com** (replace zeros with your ten-digit
   phone number).
3. Click **Generate**, it will download a text file roughly 6 KB in size.
4. This is your NVRAM Items file.
