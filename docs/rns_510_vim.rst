US RNS-510 Video In Motion
==========================

.. warning::

    Obviously playing DVDs while driving is dangerous and in the USA you'll probably get pulled over for it if a cop
    sees it depending if your state has made it illegal. Making any changes to your RNS-510 head unit always has the
    possibility of bricking the device and you'll be left with a $2000 paper weight. Proceed at your own risk.

Background
==========

After purchasing a VW 2010 Jetta SportWagen TDI with the DVD/Navigation option I've been searching for a way to get the
head unit to play DVD video while driving so that my passengers can watch their DVDs while I drive on long road trips.
I finally discovered a way to enable this feature. You will not need to purchase anything or make any prior changes.
All you need is a CD-R and a CD burner.
