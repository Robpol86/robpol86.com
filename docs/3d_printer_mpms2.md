# Monoprice Maker Select v2

I bought my first 3D printer from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018GZBC3Y) in 2018 for $300. It's on the
cheaper end but there's a large community behind it.

## Oct &#39;21 Upgrading Parts

First set up parts being upgraded with:

1. [Micro Swiss All Metal Hotend with Slotted Cooling Block](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E1HANLS)
1. [DIYE Y Carriage Plate Upgrade](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTD7DHW)
1. [Noctua NF-A4x10 FLX 3-Pin 40x10mm Fan](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009NQLT0M)
1. [ARCTIC Thermal Pad 120x20x0.5mm](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086CCPHPP)

I started to get filament jams in the middle of prints. Since I started to take the printer apart I thought it would be a
good idea to get some upgrades in.

I replaced the nozzle and hot end (except for the heat block) with an all-metal version (the original had a small teflon
tube inside the heat break), replaced the carriage plate underneath the bed with a thicker one that better resists warping,
replaced the cheap noisy fans with Noctuas with custom shortened and crimped wires, and added a thermal pad between the
heat sink and the cooling block (there was nothing there before, just metal-on-metal contact).

For crimping the wires I used the following:

* [IWISS IWS-3220M Micro Connector Pin Crimping Tool 0.03-0.52mmÂ² 32-20AWG Ratcheting Crimper](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078WPT5M1)
* [Glarks 1180 Pieces 2.54mm 2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9 Pin Housing Male and Female Compatible with JST-XHP Connector Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CTH46S7)
* [Wire Stripper Automatic 3 in 1 Multi-Function Wire Pliers (22AWG-8AWG)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XXL3B7K)

    I pushed the terminals into the connector using a paper clip to avoid kinking the thin wires.

    Applied it to the heat sink and cut out holes for the screws before threading the screws in.

    Didn't want excess thermal pad material to get jammed up in the extruder gearing so I trimmed it some more.

## Oct &#39;21 Magnetic Build Plate

I've been using a [220x220mm Borosilicate Glass Bed](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BHG5HCV) placed on top of the
BuildTak sheet that came with my printer along with glue stick with some success. This upgrade replaces all that with a
magnetic steel sheet which has a layer of PEI on it.

Items needed:

* [FYSETC 3D Printing Buildplate Steel Spring Sheet Bed w/Corner Cut 220x220mm with PEI B Magnetic Mounting Base](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082WTTD1D)
* Isopropyl alcohol (I used 91%) to remove adhesive residue
* Gloves (I used nitrile gloves) to prevent adhesive from reconstituting on your fingers

```{list-table}

    Removed the original BuildTak sheet from my Monoprice Maker Select v2.

    Got it off with some 91% isopropyl alcohol, paper towels, and nitrile gloves. Took about an hour.

    Used an old glass bed as a template to cut the corners off the magnetic sheet.

    I thought those were bubbles but it feels flat to the touch.
    :::

    Done!
    :::

    Nice and flat. The magnet holds the plate very well in place.
