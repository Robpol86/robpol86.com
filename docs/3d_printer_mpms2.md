# Monoprice Maker Select v2

I bought my first 3D printer from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018GZBC3Y) in 2018 for $300. It's on the
cheaper end but there's a large community behind it.

## Oct &#39;21 Magnetic Build Plate

I've been using a [220x220mm Borosilicate Glass Bed](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BHG5HCV) placed on top of the
BuildTak sheet that came with my printer along with glue stick with some success. This upgrade replaces all that with a
magnetic steel sheet which has a layer of PEI on it.

Items needed:

* [FYSETC 3D Printing Buildplate Steel Spring Sheet Bed w/Corner Cut 220x220mm with PEI B Magnetic Mounting Base](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082WTTD1D)
* Isopropyl alcohol (I used 91%) to remove adhesive residue
* Gloves (I used nitrile gloves) to prevent adhesive from reconstituting on your fingers
