# Monoprice Maker Select v2

I bought my first 3D printer from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018GZBC3Y) in 2018 for $300. It's on the
cheaper end but there's a large community behind it.

## Oct &#39;21 Upgrading Parts

First set up parts being upgraded with:

1. [Micro Swiss All Metal Hotend with Slotted Cooling Block](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E1HANLS)
1. [DIYE Y Carriage Plate Upgrade](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTD7DHW)
1. [Noctua NF-A4x10 FLX 3-Pin 40x10mm Fan](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009NQLT0M)
1. [ARCTIC Thermal Pad 120x20x0.5mm](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086CCPHPP)

I started to get filament jams in the middle of prints. Since I started to take the printer apart I thought it would be a
good idea to get some upgrades in.

I replaced the nozzle and hot end (except for the heat block) with an all-metal version (the original had a small teflon
tube inside the heat break), replaced the carriage plate underneath the bed with a thicker one that better resists warping,
replaced the cheap noisy fans with Noctuas with custom shortened and crimped wires, and added a thermal pad between the
heat sink and the cooling block (there was nothing there before, just metal-on-metal contact).

For crimping the wires I used the following:

* [IWISS IWS-3220M Micro Connector Pin Crimping Tool 0.03-0.52mmÂ² 32-20AWG Ratcheting Crimper](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078WPT5M1)
* [Glarks 1180 Pieces 2.54mm 2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9 Pin Housing Male and Female Compatible with JST-XHP Connector Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CTH46S7)
* [Wire Stripper Automatic 3 in 1 Multi-Function Wire Pliers (22AWG-8AWG)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XXL3B7K)

## Oct &#39;21 Magnetic Build Plate

I've been using a [220x220mm Borosilicate Glass Bed](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BHG5HCV) placed on top of the
BuildTak sheet that came with my printer along with glue stick with some success. This upgrade replaces all that with a
magnetic steel sheet which has a layer of PEI on it.

Items needed:

* [FYSETC 3D Printing Buildplate Steel Spring Sheet Bed w/Corner Cut 220x220mm with PEI B Magnetic Mounting Base](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082WTTD1D)
* Isopropyl alcohol (I used 91%) to remove adhesive residue
* Gloves (I used nitrile gloves) to prevent adhesive from reconstituting on your fingers
