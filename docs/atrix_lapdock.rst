Atrix Lapdock Other Uses
========================

I bought the Atrix Lapdock since I couldn't find any sub $100 portable HDMI displays. The only affordable displays I
could find were USB only. With the Atrix Lapdock and some adapters, I was able to use it as a portable display for
several devices, which is great for traveling.

It's a good idea to remove the plate on the docking area (underneath where the phone would be). It makes it easier to
plug in the adapters or have to sand/shave them less. You can easily pull it off with your finger nails (the plate
actually has a couple of magnets to keep it in place, and two small plastic clips).

            If you can see, I ran lsusb on the phone, removed the USB WiFi adapter, and ran lsusb again. Notice the shorter

            Lapdock as a Second Display

            The Lapdock is very handy as a second display for my laptop! At home my laptop is docked with two monitors. Now when
            I travel I can still have two monitors.

            Lapdock with a Galaxy Nexus (VZW LTE)

            The Galaxy Nexus works fine with the Lapdock, however only HDMI (video) works. The MHL standard disables USB when
            using HDMI, so the Lapdock's keyboard, touchpad, and USB ports don't work. Charging the phone works though.

            Any MHL capable phone will work with an MHL adapter. I also used a Micro HDMI female to HDMI male adapter, an HDMI
            female/female coupler (my MHL adapter has an HDMI male connector), and a MicroUSB male/female extension cable.

            In order for the Micro-HDMI and Micro-USB adapters to fit at the same time, I had to shave off a lot of excess

            Lapdock with a Wii

            I don't have a 360 or PS3, but I have a Wii and after I found an HDMI adapter I tried it with the Lapdock. Turns out
            it works just fine. The Lapdock takes care of changing resolution as long as it's at or below 1366x768. Audio works
            too by the way. This should work just fine with the Xbox 360, PS3, or any other HDMI devices.

            Lapdock with a Raspberry Pi

            The Lapdock works great with the Raspberry Pi, but with a few problems. Every time the Lapdock's lid is opened or
            closed, power is cut off the RPI for a second, causing it to reboot. Also there's a problem with the RPI's USB hub
            that prevents me from using the Lapdock's keyboard and a USB WiFi adapter.

            Lapdock with a Raspberry Pi (Adapters Used)

            The Raspberry Pi only supports power from its micro USB port, and the regular USB ports on the RPI won't allow enough
            power through. So I had to splice another USB cable into the micro USB extension and route the USB data cables (green
            and white) to the spliced cable.

Using USB OTG
-------------

Using a modified kernel with OTG_USER_CONTROL set, I was able to get the Lapdock's keyboard, mouse, and USB hub working
with my Nexus 4! While I wait for my Miracast adapter to arrive, I had to put something on the Lapdock's HDMI port to
make it turn on, so I used a Raspberry Pi for now. Here are a few observations:

* I'm using an unmodified 5-wire Micro USB B Male to Female.
* The phone **does not charge** even though the lapdock is sending power and data to the phone. Perhaps the kernel
  needs additional modification?
* In the second and third pictures I removed the small WiFi USB adapter that was plugged into the Lapdock to show that
  the phone detected it, confirming the USB hub works.
* Once I get my `PTV3000 <https://www.amazon.com/Netgear-PTV3000-100NAS-Push2TV/dp/B00904JILO>`_ I can try using the
  Lapdock's full potential with my phone.
* No multitouch mouse/touchpad :(

Steps taken to accomplish:

1. `Download <https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=38621573&postcount=121>`_ the modified kernel at the
   bottom of that post.
2. `Boot the new kernel <https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2151159>`_ following the instructions in the
   original post.
3. Plug and play!

.. note::

    Ignore the Raspberry Pi in the images below, I'm just using it to trick the Lapdock into powering on. Notice the
    mouse cursor on my phone!

    If you can see, I ran ``lsusb`` on the phone, removed the USB WiFi adapter, and ran ``lsusb`` again. Notice the
    shorter "paragraph" on my phone. Definitely working.

Using USB OTG and Miracast
--------------------------

It works, but it's not really pleasant. If we can get Keyboard/Mouse to Bluetooth working that would be much better.

With a Raspberry Pi
===================

The Lapdock works great with the Raspberry Pi, but with a few caveats:

* Every time the Lapdock's lid is opened or closed, power is cut off the RPI for a second, causing it to reboot.
* There is no "off" mode. When the lid is closed, power is cut off for a second, but then returned, so the RPI will
  power back on.

Adapters used:

* `HDMI Male to Micro HDMI Female <https://www.dealextreme.com/p/hdmi-male-to-micro-hdmi-female-adapter-66079>`_
* `Micro USB B Male to Female <https://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=270928425953>`_

.. note::

    The Raspberry Pi only supports power from its micro USB port, and the regular USB ports on the RPI won't allow
    enough power through. So I had to splice another USB cable into the micro USB extension and route the USB data
    cables (green and white) to the spliced cable.

With a Laptop
=============

I can use the Atrix Lapdock as a secondary display for my laptop. At home my laptop is docked to two monitors, so every
time I traveled I had to deal with a single monitor. Not anymore! Adapters used:

* `HDMI Male to Micro HDMI Female <https://www.dealextreme.com/p/hdmi-male-to-micro-hdmi-female-adapter-66079>`_
* HDMI Female/Female Coupler

Lapdock 500 Teardown
====================

    :widths: 10 10

    * - .. thumb-figure:: /_images/pictures/imgur-import/imgur-on1EG.jpg
            :resize-width: 400

            Step 1: First Set of Screws to Remove

            To start the teardown, remove most of the rubber grommets/feet on the underside of the Lapdock to access the screws.
            There are 15 screws total (not counting the two used for the pull-out tray).

      - .. thumb-figure:: /_images/pictures/imgur-import/imgur-4zK6V.jpg
            :resize-width: 400

            Step 2: Removing the Keyboard

            The second step is to remove the keyboard. There are five tabs that need to be pushed in (I used a small flathead
            screwdriver) near the Esc, F3, F7, F11, and Del keys. Don't push too hard. The keyboard should be able to lift right
            off once all the tabs are pushed in. With the keyboard out, lightly tug on its ribbon cable to disconnect it from the
            Lapdock's controller board. Do the same with the touchpad's cable while you're at it.

            :resize-width: 400

            Step 3: Removing the Plastic Cover

            Gently tug up on the black plastic panel covering the IO ports. I pulled out the phone drawer and started pulling up
            from there.

      - .. thumb-figure:: /_images/pictures/imgur-import/imgur-qVXHC.jpg
            :resize-width: 400

            Step 4: Removing the Palm Rest

            The palm rest is held down both by screws (the bottom set which you've already removed, and the set underneath the
            keyboard) and plastic clips around the perimeter. I started things off by pushing up from underneath on the screw
            holes (using a Phillips) and using a flathead to pry the bottom part of the Lapdock (which curves up) from the palm
            rest. Be very gentle, the clips are fragile and I broke one during this step.

    * - .. thumb-figure:: /_images/pictures/imgur-import/imgur-VxcB7.jpg
            :resize-width: 400

            Step 5: Removing the Monitor

            With the palm rest removed you can see the Lapdock's controller board. There are two cables coming from the monitor.
            To remove the bigger cable you gently tug on the cord. The cable should disconnect from the connector. To remove the
            smaller cable, I used my thumb nails (both) to pry the plastic connector from the controller.

            :resize-width: 400

            Step 6: Lapdock 500 With No Monitor

            After removing five screws on the hinge bases (attached to the Lapdock's base; three screws on the left, two on the
            right) the monitor should lift right off.

            The perfect Raspberry Pi Laptop

            If someone can help me hack this stupid Lapdock 500 to work with any HDMI input, this would be possible! I would
            probably have to remove a few components from the Pi though.
